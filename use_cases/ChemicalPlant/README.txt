This folder contains sytheticly generated data, RAVEN input files to 
train ARMAs with this data, and HERON input files that use these ARMAs.

HERON input files are modified versions of those used in the DOW CRADA 
report.  The large plant has two input files.  Both can be used to 
select the appropriate reactor technology for the plant integration.  
One is an optimization case with a continuous reactor capacity, the other 
is a sweep of fixed reactor capacities. The small plant also has two 
HERON input files, a optimization and sweep.  In which the reactor and 
thermal energy storage capacities are being evaluated.
